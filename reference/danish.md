# Danish reinsurance claim dataset

The univariate dataset was collected at Copenhagen Reinsurance and
comprise 2167 fire losses over the period 1980 to 1990. They have been
adjusted for inflation to reflect 1985 values and are expressed in
millions of Danish Krone.

The multivariate data set is the same data as above but the total claim
has been divided into a building loss, a loss of contents and a loss of
profits.

```
