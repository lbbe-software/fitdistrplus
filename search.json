Nevertheless, statistics used cautiously comparing fits various distributions. Keeping mind weighting CDF quadratic difference depends parametric distribution definition (see Table @ref(tab:tabKSCvMAD)), Anderson-Darling statistics computed several distributions fitted data set theoretically difficult compare. Moreover, statistic, Cramer-von Mises Kolmogorov-Smirnov ones, take account complexity model (.e., parameter number). problem compared distributions characterized number parameters, systematically promote selection complex distributions case. Looking classical penalized criteria based loglikehood (AIC, BIC) seems thus also interesting, especially discourage overfitting. previous example, goodness--fit statistics based CDF distance favor Burr distribution, one characterized three parameters, AIC BIC values respectively give preference Burr distribution Pareto distribution. choice two distributions seems thus less obvious discussed. Even specifically recommended discrete distributions, Chi-squared statistic may also used continuous distributions (see Section 3.3. reference manual examples (Delignette-Muller et al. 2014)).","code":"fw <- fitdist(groundbeef$serving, \"weibull\") summary(fw) ## Fitting of the distribution ' weibull ' by maximum likelihood  ## Parameters :  ##       estimate Std.

Computations goodness--fit statistics yet developed fits using censored data quality fit can judged using Akaike Schwarz’s Bayesian information criteria (AIC BIC) goodness--fit CDF plot, respectively provided summarizing plotting object class fitdistcens. Functions cdfcompcens, qqcompcens ppcompcens can also used compare fit various distributions censored data set. calls similar ones cdfcomp, qqcomp ppcomp. examples use functions two fitted distributions salinity data set (see Figure @ref(fig:cdfcompcens)). qqcompcens ppcompcens used one fitted distribution, non uniqueness rectangles filled small noise added y-axis order help visualization various fits. rather recommend use plotstyle ggplot qqcompcens ppcompcens compare fits various distributions provides clearer plot splitted facets (see ?graphcompcens). goodness--fit plots fits lognormal loglogistic distribution censored data: LC50 values salinity data set.  Function bootdistcens equivalent bootdist censored data, except proposes nonparametric bootstrap. Indeed, obvious simulate censoring within parametric bootstrap resampling procedure. generic function quantile can also applied object class fitdistcens bootdistcens, continuous non-censored data. addition fit distributions censored non censored continuous data, package can also accomodate discrete variables, count numbers, using functions developped continuous non-censored data. functions provide somewhat different graphs statistics, taking account discrete nature modeled variable. discrete nature variable automatically recognized classical distribution fitted data (binomial, negative binomial, geometric, hypergeometric Poisson distributions) must indicated fixing argument discrete TRUE call functions cases. toxocara data set included package corresponds observation discrete variable.
