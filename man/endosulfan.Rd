\title{Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) for endosulfan}

\description{
Summary of 48- to 96-hour acute toxicity values (LC50 and EC50 values)
for exposure of Australian an Non-Australian taxa to endosulfan. 
}

\usage{
data(endosulfan)
}

\format{ 
\code{endosulfan} is a data frame with 4 columns, named ATV for Acute Toxicity Value
(geometric mean of LC50 ou EC50 values in micrograms per liter),
Australian (coding for Australian or another origin), group 
(arthropods, fish or non-arthropod invertebrates) and taxa.
